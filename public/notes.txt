redux is a replacement for Global Data Context

redux is a state management library

why do we need global data management, to share data across components and management
    make data available across the whole App


when to choose between redux and GDC

GDC is faster for small apps

redux is made for bigger applications
  large setup but easier for use in large applications


redux is a predictable data container
 main feature - unidirectional flow of data
 only single source of information

install npm i react-redux

nstall npm i @reduxjs/toolkit


create 2 components 
    products
        iphone  --add to cart
        mouse   -- add to cart
        keyboard --add to cart

    cart 
        on cart screen, increment the items in the cart
        show 3 items in the cart 

redux requires
Store  -- the big comtainer -- a lake of data
store has small slices
    { productSlice,
        orderslice,
        userSlice,
        cartSlice
    }
    the Slices are the sub-containers
    one slice has "data", and some functions to modify the data.
    data is refered as STATE and functions are refered to as "REDUCERS"
